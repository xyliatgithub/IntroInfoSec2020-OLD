# Lab Assignment 4

## Environment Setup

For each lab module, you have to create a seperate **slice** in GENI, and reserve resources as decribed in lab manuals. After the resources are available, connect to those VMs through ssh and do the correspondent tasks. If you have difficulty setting up the environment, please refer to the [beginner's guide](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/GENIExperimenter/Tutorials) for GENI.

### GENI 101

Set up your GENI Account

1. Go to https://portal.geni.net and log in with your JHU ID. You may need to search for "Johns Hopkins" the first time.
2. After you are logged into the GENI Portal, find _Join the Project_ button and request to join the class project named **InfoSecClass2019**.
3. Once you are approved to join the project, you can create your own experimental _slices_.
